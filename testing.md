# Scrambled Tech Testing

## Manual Testing
Manual testing of the application was carried out continuously from early development to ensure all bugs were fixed and any issues with functionality were resolved at an early stage. Print statements were used throughout the game to ensure correct functionality during development. After deployment, a final full testing has been carried out, as detailed in the table below.
